**About**
=======================

Over 3.4 million pediatric COVID-19 cases have been documented in the United States, however, much is still unknown regarding pediatric disease activity[1]. Moreover, while interest in COVID-19 remains high, most publicly available dashboards focus on infection rather than hospitalization rates, though the later can drive further insight into disease severity. Thus, the presented dashboard facilitate national, regional, state, and city level temporal comparison of COVID-19 hospitalizations between adults and children. Data was acquired through the US Department of Health and Human Services which is publicly available and has captured daily hospitalization reports across all 50 states since July 31, 2020[2].
